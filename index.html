      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I enojoy living a life that I don't need to take a vacation from. This involves spending lots of time with family and friends, generally in locations that feature a view of water, a view of beer, or preferably, both. In order to pay for this lifestyle I work as a professional musician. In the past I have also taught in a public elementary school. I have no fear... I can do anything... I taught kindergarten and survived.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Bermuda and before I was 10 lived there, Memphis, Pensacola, Jacksonville, Melbourne, and Palm Bay.  I attended college in central Minnesota.  Since 2002 I've called Central Florida home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy walking, reading, and hanging out at theme parks. I enjoy the theater and have a season subscription to the Orlando Broadway series. I recently attended the ballet for the first time and loved that too.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one that is intellectually stimulating and creative, while also being mostly stress-free.  It will allow me flexibility to focus on relationships with family and friends. Financially, it will set me up to be able to afford the lifestyle I enjoy and enable me to save for retirement. I will work to live, not live to work. (I did that when I was in my 20's.)  I don't know what this dream job is exactly yet.  But I intend to find it and enjoy it.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the attractions area on Destination Parkway. My walks take me around the convention center.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am looking for a job that is both creative and intelectually stimulating. Web development seems to fit that description. Web development offers me potential for growth, change, and opportunity.</p>
